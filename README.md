# Pesticide_Exposure_Detection

To meet the growing demand for food modern farmerâ€™s use pesticides for crop protection and to increase yield production. However, the widespread use of pesticides in agriculture has many adverse effects on human health as well as environmental sustainability. Exposure to pesticides has many side effects and causes many health problems such as cancers, renal failures, immune suppression, genetic disorders, etc. Harmful chemicals enter the body in many ways, but exposure to these harsh chemicals is more common in people who are involved in agricultural practices. In our study, we have used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2015 to 2016 across the U.S. from different groups. The main objective of our study is to discern the most effective and optimal model to classify people into higher risk and lower risk of diagnosing renal failure and other health issues using classification models like Linear classifier, Random Forest classifier, KNN, Decision tree classifier, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression and ensemble techniques. Further, using feature selection like select K- best and getting p-significant features are used in dimension reduction techniques and the results are compared using evaluation metrics like accuracy, f1-score, Recall and precision from all the developed models.
